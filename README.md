- 👋 Hi, I’m @fiona-pearce
- 👀 I’m interested in using using routinely collected healthcare data to improve health outcomes in rare diseases. I lead the Registration of Complex Rare Diseases Exemplars in Rheumatology (RECORDER) in collaboration with the National Disease Registration Service at NHS Digital.
- 🌱 My current projects assess effects of COVID-19 on people with rare diseases, & describe the epidemiology needed to plan better healthcare services and pave the way for the introduction of new treatments in rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on codelists, SQL/Stata/R code to use in HES for data extraction, incidence and prevalence analyses.
